State-of-the-art Machine Learning for the web. Run ü§ó Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server!

Transformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face's [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:
  - üìù **Natural Language Processing**: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
  - üñºÔ∏è **Computer Vision**: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
  - üó£Ô∏è **Audio**: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.
  - üêô **Multimodal**: zero-shot image classification.

Transformers.js uses [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to run models in the browser. The best part about it, is that you can easily [convert](#convert-your-models-to-onnx) your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX using [ü§ó Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum#onnx--onnx-runtime). 

For more information, check out the full [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js).


## Quick tour


It's super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the python library, we support the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it the easiest way to run models with the library.

<table>
<tr>
<th width="440px" align="center"><b>Python (original)</b></th>
<th width="440px" align="center"><b>Javascript (ours)</b></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
pipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

out = pipe('I love transformers!')
# [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999806941}]
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
import { pipeline } from '@xenova/transformers';

// Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis');

let out = await pipe('I love transformers!');
// [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999817686}]
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


You can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the second argument to the `pipeline` function. For example:
```javascript
// Use a different model for sentiment-analysis
let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment');
```


## Installation


To install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xenova/transformers), run:
```bash
npm i @xenova/transformers
```

Alternatively, you can use it in vanilla JS, without any bundler, by using a CDN or static hosting. For example, using [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), you can import the library with:
```html
<script type="module">
    import { pipeline } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xenova/transformers@2.4.2';
</script>
```

## Custom usage



By default, Transformers.js uses [hosted pretrained models](https://huggingface.co/models) and [precompiled WASM binaries](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xenova/transformers@2.4.2/dist/), which should work out-of-the-box. You can customize this as follows:


### Settings

```javascript
import { env } from '@xenova/transformers';

// Specify a custom location for models (defaults to '/models/').
env.localModelPath = '/path/to/models/';

// Disable the loading of remote models from the Hugging Face Hub:
env.allowRemoteModels = false;

// Set location of .wasm files. Defaults to use a CDN.
env.backends.onnx.wasm.wasmPaths = '/path/to/files/';
```

For a full list of available settings, check out the [API Reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/api/env).

### Convert your models to ONNX

We recommend using our [conversion script](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/blob/main/scripts/convert.py) to convert your PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX in a single command. Behind the scenes, it uses [ü§ó Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum) to perform conversion and quantization of your model.

```bash
python -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id <model_name_or_path>
```

For example, convert and quantize [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) using:
```bash
python -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id bert-base-uncased
```

This will save the following files to `./models/`:

```
bert-base-uncased/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tokenizer.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tokenizer_config.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ onnx/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model.onnx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model_quantized.onnx
```


## Supported tasks/models
